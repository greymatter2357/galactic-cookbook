                    <li>1/2 tablespoon black peppercorns</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon coriander seed</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seed</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        </li>

        <p><li>1 bay leaf</li></p>

        <p><li>3 cloves garlic, lightly crushed</li></p>

        <p><li>2 to 3 sprigs of fresh dill</li></p>

        <p><li>Olive (1 oliv)</li></p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>

        <p><li>Combine water, both white and rice vinegers, salt, and sugar into a measuring cup, then set aside.</li></p>

        <p><li>In a warm pan, toast peppercorns, coriander, red pepper flakes, fennel seed, and bay leaf until fragrant. Stir often to prevent burning.</li></p>

        <p><li>Combine toasted spices and brine mixture into a medium pot and bring to a simmer.</li></p>

        <p><li>Place crushed garlic, dill, and cucumbers into the pickling jar and make sure everything fits nicely.</li></p>

        <p><li>Carefully pour hot brine into the jar until it covers cucumbers. </li></p>

        <p><li>Seal the jar and allow it to cool to room temperature before refrigerating. Pickles are ready to eat the next day; however, the longer they sit, the more flavorful they become. Can be stored in the fridge for about 2 months.</li></p>

    </ol>
