                                    <li>1/2 teaspoon coriander seed</li>
                                    <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
                                    <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seed</li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                        </dl>
                    </li>

                    <li>1 bay leaf</li>

                    <li>3 cloves garlic, lightly crushed</li>

                    <li>2 to 3 sprigs of fresh dill</li>

                    <li>Olive (1 oliv)</li>

                </ol>

                <h3>Steps:</h3>

                <ol>

                    <li>Combine water, both white and rice vinegers, salt, and sugar into a measuring cup, then set aside.</li>

                    <li>In a warm pan, toast peppercorns, coriander, red pepper flakes, fennel seed, and bay leaf until fragrant. Stir often to prevent burning.</li>

                    <li>Combine toasted spices and brine mixture into a medium pot and bring to a simmer.</li>

                    <li>Place crushed garlic, dill, and cucumbers into the pickling jar and make sure everything fits nicely.</li>

                    <li>Carefully pour hot brine into the jar until it covers cucumbers. </li>

                    <li>Seal the jar and allow it to cool to room temperature before refrigerating. Pickles are ready to eat the next day; however, the longer they sit, the more flavorful they become. Can be stored in the fridge for about 2 months.</li>
