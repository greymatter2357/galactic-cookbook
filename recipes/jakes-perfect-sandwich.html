    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>A warning to all who would continue down this road that leads to sandwich perfection…</p>

    <p>Abandon hope. Kiss your friends and family goodbye. If you had a social life, give it a merciful death. This sandwich will devour your life, your soul, and everything that remotely resembles free time.  When all was said and done, this amazing, delicious, perfect sandwich took me four hours to make (not including grocery shopping time). It was not easy. It was not quick.</p>
        
    <p>But by god it was delicious. </p>
        
    <p>In the end it was so enormous that I couldn’t close it and make it one sandwich and it ended up being two sandwich halves that everyone got a piece from each one, so that’s how I’ll be doing the recipe. Still brave enough to push on?</p> 

    <p>Ok then, LET's BEGIN!!!</p>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Step 1 - Mood Music</strong></dt>
            <dd><p>Put some Classical music or soft jazz.</p></dd> 
             
            <dt><strong>Step 2 - Steak, Sous-Vide</strong></dt>
            <dd>
            <p>Cooking steak sous-vide is time consuming but highly rewarding. It does not give your steak a crispy buttery crust on the outside though, so if you want that crust on your steak I suggest patting your steak dry and then giving it a quick sear in a hot cast iron skillet once it’s done cooking. 
            </p>

            <p>Place your steak, a few springs of fresh rosemary and the fresh thyme into a large plastic bag and suck all of the air out of it. You don’t need any oil or butter - being cooking in a water bath will infuse the steak with the flavor of these herbs. Keep a thermometer clipped to your pot with the temperature tip in the water so that you don’t overcook your steak. Place the bag into your hot water and then don’t touch it. Don’t even look at it. Just keep the water at a constant temperature and set your timer. </p>
            <p>Generally an hour is goof for an inch-thick steak. For a medium-rare steak, keep the water temperature at about 131 degrees F. Jake’s 134 degrees will give you a slightly more-cooked steak, but everyone has their own preference for steak perfection.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><strong>Step 3 - Bread and Lobster Soul</strong></dt>
            <dd><p>While your steak is cooking away, you can begin to prepare the rest of the sandwich. Slice your loaf of bread in half horizontally and put both halves on a baking sheet. Brush this with a little olive oil and then put it into a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes to get it nice and crispy.</p>

            <p>In a large bowl, mix together the lobster meat, a tablespoon of minced yellow onion, lemon juice, cream cheese, chopped dill, and butter. Cry into it a little bit over how many dishes you’ll have to do later, but please, no snot. </p>

            <p>When the bread comes out of the oven, give it a few minutes to cool and then spread your lobster cream cheese dip over both halves. Drape pickles over both sides. Reward yourself with a glass of white wine.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Step 4 - Diced Boiled Eggs and Bird From the Window</strong></dt>
            <dd><p>Let’s just call this chicken. Put your chicken breast in a small pot and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour in chicken broth and a splash of white wine until it covers the chicken by an inch or so and bring that sucker to a boil. Skim off any scummy foam that floats to the top. Once it boils, reduce to a simmer, cover the pot, and let the chicken breast simmer for 10 minutes or so until it’s opaque in the middle and an instant-read thermometer reads 165 degrees F. Slice the chicken into thin strips. You can also hard-boil your eggs in this if you want to, though I used a separate pot of water for them. Slice those thinly too once they’re cool. Set both aside for construction of the sandwich.</p></dd>
            <dt><strong>Step 5 - Everything Else and Construction</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Once your steak finishes cooking and you’ve decided whether to sear it or not, slice it into thin strips. Cook up those delicious strips of bacon in a shallow pan or bake them! Baking bacon makes it extra crispy and good for crumbling onto your sandwich.</p>

                <p>At this point you can decide what goes on which half of the sandwich, but here’s a breakdown of how I ended up building it -

                    <dl>
                        <dt><strong>SANDWICH HALF 1:</strong></dt>
                        <dd><p>Bread - lobster cream cheese dip - pickles - steak - crumbled crispy bacon - hard-boiled eggs</p></dd>

                        <dt><strong>SANDWICH HALF 2:</strong></dt>
                        <dd><p>Bread - lobster cream cheese dip - pickles - sliced Roma tomatoes - sweet yellow onion - Japanese cucumbers - crumbled crispy bacon - sliced chicken breast </p></dd>
                    </dl>
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Step 6 - Feast</strong></dt>
            <dd><p>You earned it, you master sandwich-maker. Share it with your friends! Or not. We know you want it all to yourself and we understand.</p></dd>
